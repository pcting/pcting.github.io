      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using a lot of Go in my day to day job. I also have a strong love for open-source software community as almost all the software I depend on comes from the open-source community.
This brings me to introduce my new project godot-go; Go bindings for the Godot game engine. I hope I can pull together a community to bring live into the project.
This is the accummulation of a year woth of my off-hours software development time trying to get Cgo and Godot to work nicely together.</description>
