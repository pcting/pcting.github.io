I've always had a love of video games and by extension it's been a childhood desire to get involved with game development. This desire has been a driving factor with my career in software engineering. I think this is a very common scenario for many software engineers out there.

I've been using a lot of [Go](https://golang.org/) in my day to day job. I also have a strong love for open source software as almost all the software I depend on comes from the open source community. I decided to pick a project that would marry Go with game development.

This brings me to gladly introduce project [godot-go](https://github.com/pcting/godot-go). Project godot-go intorduces the Go language with the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) game engine.

This is the accummulation of a years woth of my off-hours software development time trying to get [Cgo](https://golang.org/cmd/cgo/) and Godot to work nicely together. I'd like to give thanks to an existing [ShadowApex/godot-go](https://github.com/ShadowApex/godot-go/) project, which has since been abandoned. I hope to contineu where ShadowApex left off.

Please download and play around with it. If you have any questions, you can find me as **surgical#3758** in [gdnative-dev](https://discord.gg/Xjnz2t) room in the Godot Discord servers.
