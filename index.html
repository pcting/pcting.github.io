  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <p>
    My name is Patrick Ting. I'm a software engineer.
    I've been programming for more than 10 years; I am really passionate about it; I don't intend to stop anytime soon.
    I enjoy my relaxed life in Orange County, but I'm always ready to go wherever opportunities may take me.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've currently very interested in all things Scala, Hadoop, and machine learning related. So, hit me up if you have any Scala related projects you need help on!
